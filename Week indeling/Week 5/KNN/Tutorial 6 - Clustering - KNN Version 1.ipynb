    "### 1. Explanation of k-nearest neighbor method\n",
    "\n",
    "K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is mostly used for regression and classification. It is a supervised algorithm. It is good in three things:\n",
    "- It has an easy interpretable output. \n",
    "- It has a short calculation time. \n",
    "- It is good at predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we’ll show an easy example. (Example and explanation from: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/03/introduction-k-neighbours-algorithm-clustering/) \n",
    "\n",
    "We have 3 red circles, 3 green squares and a blue star. We want to know the classification of the blue star. This will be red circles or green squares. Take k as the number of neighbors. In this case we’ll take k = 3. Now we draw a circle around the blue star, in such a way that there are exactly 3 datapoints in the circle. We can see that there are only red circles in the circle, and thus the blue star belongs to the red circles.  \n",

    "<img src=\"Ex_cl_KNN2.PNG\" width=500/>\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing is of course, the value of k. Small values will cause the noise to have a higher influence on the result, but a high value will make it hard to compute. The simplest way to choose it is $k = \\sqrt{n}$, with n the number of datapoints in the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Down below another method is explained. It takes the shortest Euclidean distance to see which neighobrs are the closest. Nextly, it determines the most occuring class. Then it checks whether this class is right. When this is tried out for several classes, you can determine which is best.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we use Euclidean distance, but several kinds of distances can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Euclidean distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the square root of the sum of the squares of the difference of the coordinates.\n",
    "For example: $x=(a,b)$ and $y=(c,d)$ then the Euclidean distance is $\\sqrt{{(a-c)}^2+{(b-d)}^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Manhattan distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the sum of the absolute values of the differences of the coordinates.\n",
    "For example: $x=(a,b)$ and $y=(c,d)$ then the Manhattan distance is $|a-c| + |b-d|$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Minkowski distance\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually the most general form.\n",
    "The formula is $D = \\sqrt[p]{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} {|x-y|}^p}$.\n",
    "When p = 1, you use Manhattan distance, when p = 2, you use Euclidean distance."
