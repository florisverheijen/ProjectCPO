    "### 1.1 What is PCA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, the size of the data has become a main bottleneck for the performance of many machine learning algorithms. Therefore, the data should be reduced so that machine learning algorithms can perform well. Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of the solutions for this problem. \n",
    "PCA performs a linear transformation on the data, making a multidimensional data into a two- or three-dimensions data, which is easier to visualize. In such a manner, PCA is a dimensionality reduction method. Large datasets have different variance values. The goal of PCA is to find the biggest variance values, because these values contain most of the information when the data is reduced. The biggest variance will be expressed in the first principal component (PC 1). The second principal component contains the second largest variance, and so on. There are as many principal components as there are variables. However, only the PCs with the most variance will be used. These few principal components will be plot orthogonally (figure 1). That means the first principal component will be on the x axis and the second on the y axis.(Hereafter, there will be explained how it is possible to define the number of principal component and in which way you plot these data). The plot of the reduced dataset will contain as much as possible information about the original dataset. The plot will show the correlation between the most important variables of the original dataset. [Source 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123838360000175) \n",

    "### 1.2 Application of PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "*\t**Data visualization.** In today’s world, the volume of the data and the variables that define the data are the mean challenges. You need extensive data exploration to find out how the variables are correlated or to understand the distribution of a few features. Considering a large dataset with many features/ variables.  Visualization can be a challenge and almost impossible. Hence, PCA could be have a great contribution to this problem. PCA could do this almost impossible visualization for you since it projects the large dataset into a lower dimension thereby allowing you to visualize the data in a 2D or 3D space with a naked eye.\n",
    "*\t**Speeding Machine Learning (ML) Algorithm.** When you have to deal with a large dataset, it is possible that the ML algorithm’s learning become too slow. With PCA it is possible to speed up the machine learning testing considering the data has a lot of features since PCA reduce the dimension of the data. \n",

    "### Step 1: Importation and preparation of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "This step is one of the most important steps during data analysis. The possibilities are enormous for importation and preparation of the dataset. In this course, the focus will be on the importation of the data with pandas. As well, the preparation will be done mostly with pandas' function. In this tutorial, this step is already done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Standardization. \n",
    "Standardization implies that the data would be scaled in a way that all the values of the variables lie within a similar range. This could be expressed with the following formula: \n",
    "Z = (variable value- mean)/ standard deviation \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 3: Calculation of the covariance matrix. <br>\n",
    "A little revision of the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix defines both the spread (variance), and the orientation (covariance) of the data. The variances are the diagonal elements and the covariances are the off-diagonal elements of the matrix. If the data is an N-dimensional data than the covariance matrix becomes an N x N matrix. For instance, the spread of a three-dimensional data will capture in a 3 x 3 covariance matrix. The covariance matrix S is defined by <br>\n",
    "$$S=\\frac{1}{N-1}BB^T$$ The computation of covariance matrix is necessary, because the values will be need in the following steps. [Source 5](https://www.visiondummy.com/2014/04/geometric-interpretation-covariance-matrix/)\n",

    "### Step 4: Calculation of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. \n",
    "A little review of the definition of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. An eigenvector of a matrix A<sub>NxN</sub> is a nonzero vector x such that A$\\bullet$X = $\\lambda$X applies. An eigenvector is also a vector whose direction does not change when a linear transformation is performed.\n",
    "Eigenvalues ( $\\lambda$ in the formula) denote the magnitude of the respective eigenvectors. The eigenvalues are the values on the diagonal of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors cannot be found directly in the covariance matrix. They must be calculated. The calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors is important, because the eigenvector with the largest respective eigenvalue contains the most variance (most information of the data). The eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalue is called principal component 1 (PC1). PCs are the new set of variables that are obtained from the initial set of variables. They compress and possess most of the useful information that was scattered among the initial variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information:\n",
    "* [Link to YouTube video - CompX: Mathematics of PCA - Matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH8pouRwphA)\n",

    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 5: Determining the most important principal component.  \n",
    "In the previous step is explained that the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues contain the most information. Hence, it is important to find these values. Is this step the eigenvalues and eigenvectors will be listed in tuples. Thereafter, the list of tuples will be sort and put in the reverse order so that the biggest eigenvalues will be at the top of the list. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 6: Calculation of the explained or overall variance. \n",
    "How many principal components do you need to get a new dataset with as much as possible information and the fewest dimensions? A useful measure is the ‘explained variance’ or overall variance, which can be calculated from the eigenvalues. The explained variance determines how much information (variance) can be attributed to each of the principal components. This will be done by calculating the sum of all the eigenvalues. Next, for each eigenvalue will be calculated for how much percentage they contribute to the sum of all the eigenvalues.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 7: Cumulative plot of the principal components and a scree plot.\n",
    "Principal components are created in order of the amount of variation they cover. Each of them contributes some information of the data. Leaving out PCs and we lose information. The good news is, if the first two or three PCs have capture most of the information, then we can ignore the rest without losing anything important.\n",
    "With a cumulative plot, it will be easier to see how much principal component are needed. When the cumulative plot is above 70 %, the principal components that form this 70 % give a good approach of the entire dataset. [Source 6](http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/31-principal-component-methods-in-r-practical-guide/112-pca-principal-component-analysis-essentials/#visualization-and-interpretation) The cumulative plot will be made with the percentage of the eigenvalues which are calculated in the previous step. This plot will contain a step and bar plot. The bar plot makes it clear which principal component is the largest. With the step plot it is easy to see when the selected principal components contain enough information so that the decision can be made that the principal components contain enough information (Figure 2). <br>\n",
    "Another option for the visualization is a scree plot. A scree plot displays how much variation each principal component captures from the data. The y axis is eigenvalues, which essentially stand for the amount of variation. An ideal curve should be steep, then bends at an “elbow” — this is your cutting-off point — and after that flattens out. In figure 3, just PC 1,2, and 3 are enough to describe the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with a not-so-ideal scree plot curve, there are a couple ways: (This will not be covered in this course)\n",
    "* Kaiser rule: pick PCs with eigenvalues of at least 1.\n",
    "* Proportion of variance plot: the selected PCs should be able to describe at least 80% of the variance.\n",
    "If you end up with too many principal components (more than 3), PCA might not be the best way to visualize your data. Instead, consider other dimension reduction techniques, such as t-SNE and MDS. <br>\n",

    "  \n",
    "### Step 8: Reducing the dimensions.\n",
    "The number of the principal component that have been selected in the previous step will be put in a new matrix named projection matrix (W). The inner product of the projection matrix and the standardized matrix will be calculated. With this inner product, the original data will be plotted on the new subspace. In other words, a linear transformation is performed. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 9: Plotting the data. \n",
    "In this step, you plot the transformed data in a scatterplot. PC1 will always be on the x axis, PC2 on the y-as and so on. The data may contain labels. In this tutorial, the dataset contains the labels Benign and Malignant. These labels get a different color so that it becomes visual how the features of these labels difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 10: Interpretation of the data.\n",
    "The vizualation will be explained through an example with a dataset named iris dataset. [Source 10](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. If PCA is applied on the iris dataset, the plot in figure 4 will be obtained. It could be seen that the four dimenions are reduced to two dimensions (PC1 and PC2). This is done because PC1 and PC2 contain almost 100% of the variance. <br> <br>\n",
    "The important question is now, how to interpret this plot? <br> <br>\n",
    "There are three labels (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). In an ideal PCA plot you will observe that these labels had formed separated clusters (groups). Because the samples associated with a particular label have roughly the same properties. If the clusters are different based on PC1 (they different in location on the x axis), differences are likely to be due to the variables that have heavy influences on PC1. If the clusters are different based on PC2 then the variables that heavily influences PC2 are likely to be responsible for the difference.  \n",
    "The PCs are ranked by how much variance they contain. PC1 reveals the most variation, while PC2 reveals the second most variation. Therefore, differences among clusters along PC1 axis are actually larger than the similar-looking distances along PC1 axis. <br> <br>\n",
    "The second important question is, which variables influences PC1 the most and which PC2? <br> <br>\n",
    "This question could be answered with plotting a loading plot. A loading plot shows how strongly each variable influences a principal component. The loading plot for the first two PCs of the iris dataset could be seen in figure 5. See how these vectors are pinned at the origin of PCs (PC1 = 0 and PC2 = 0)? Their project values on each PC show how much weight they have on that PC. In this example, petal_len, petal_wid and sepal_len strongly influence PC1, while sepal_wid have more say in PC2. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another nice thing about loading plots: the angles between the vectors tell us how characteristics correlate with one another. \n",
    "* When two vectors are close, forming a small angle, the two variables they represent are positively correlated. \n",
    "* If they meet each other at 90°, they are not likely to be correlated.\n",
    "* When they diverge and form a large angle (close to 180°), they are negative correlated. \n",
