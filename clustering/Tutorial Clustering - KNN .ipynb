    "K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is mostly used for regression and classification. It is a supervised algorithm. It is good in three things:\n",
    "- It has an easy interpretable output. \n",
    "- It has a short calculation time. \n",
    "- It is good at predictions. \n",

    "First, we’ll show an easy example. (Example and explanation from: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/03/introduction-k-neighbours-algorithm-clustering/) \n",
    "\n",
    "We have 3 red circles, 3 green squares and a blue star. We want to know the classification of the blue star. This will be red circles or green squares. Take k as the number of neighbors. In this case we’ll take k = 3. Now we draw a circle around the blue star, in such a way that there are exactly 3 datapoints in the circle. We can see that there are only red circles in the circle, and thus the blue star belongs to the red circles.  \n",
